# Why the process holds under pressure

Read this when skipping a phase feels justified. `systematic-debugging` keeps only the red flags; this is
the rest.

## Your human partner's signals you are doing it wrong

- "Is that not happening?" - you assumed without verifying
- "Will it show us...?" - you should have added evidence gathering
- "Stop guessing" - you are proposing fixes without understanding
- "Ultra-think this" - question fundamentals, not just symptoms
- "We're stuck?" (frustrated) - your approach is not working

**When you see these:** stop, and return to Phase 1.

## Common rationalizations

| Excuse | Reality |
|--------|---------|
| "Issue is simple, don't need process" | Simple issues have root causes too. Process is fast for simple bugs. |
| "Emergency, no time for process" | Systematic debugging is FASTER than guess-and-check thrashing. |
| "Just try this first, then investigate" | First fix sets the pattern. Do it right from the start. |
| "I'll write test after confirming fix works" | Untested fixes don't stick. Test first proves it. |
| "Multiple fixes at once saves time" | Can't isolate what worked. Causes new bugs. |
| "Reference too long, I'll adapt the pattern" | Partial understanding guarantees bugs. Read it completely. |
| "I see the problem, let me fix it" | Seeing symptoms ≠ understanding root cause. |
| "One more fix attempt" (after 2+ failures) | 3+ failures = architectural problem. Question pattern, don't fix again. |

## Real-world impact

From debugging sessions:

- Systematic approach: 15-30 minutes to fix
- Random fixes approach: 2-3 hours of thrashing
- First-time fix rate: 95% vs 40%
- New bugs introduced: near zero vs common
